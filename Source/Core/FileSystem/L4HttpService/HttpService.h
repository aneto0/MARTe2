/**
 * @brief Implementation of an HTTP server.
 * @see MultiClientService.
 *
 * @details Performs the following tasks:\n
 *   - Waits on the principal socket for a new client connection.\n
 *   - Once a new client is connected, the new socket is created to handle the
 *     specific connection and a new thread is launched with the ServerCycle task to
 *     manage new client connections.\n
 *   -The current thread with the new created socket calls the ClientService function to
 *    manage the client HTTP requests.\n
 *   - Once the client closes the connection (or in case of error) the thread terminates.\n
 * @details The client can send a specific HTTP command called TextMode to express that it wants to receive data
 * in text mode (TextMode=1) or in database mode (TextMode=0). If TextMode=1, the HttpService will call the
 * DataExportI::GetAsText of the object found at the path received from the client, or DatExportI::GetAsStructuredData if
 * TextMode=0. In this second case a StructuredDataStream<JsonPrinter> is passed in input to the DatExportI::GetAsStructuredData
 * in order to send to the client data written in json language.
 *
 * @details The HttpService replies to the client always using the HTTP chunked transfer encoding. This allows to stream out
 * data to the socket without knowing a priori the full length of the HTTP message body. This allows to avoid having to store the
 * whole body in memory before sending it.
 *
 * @details The configuration syntax is (names are only given as an example):
 * <pre>
 * +HttpService1 = {
 *     Class = HttpService
 *     AcceptTimeout = 1000 //Optional (default = 1000).  Timeout in the TCPSocket::WaitConnection to wait for new client connections.
 *     Port = 8084 //Optional (default = 80). The HTTP server port.
 *     Timeout = 0 //Compulsory. See MultiClientService::Initialise
 *     MaxNumberOfThreads = 8 //Compulsory. See MultiClientService::Initialise
 *     ListenMaxConnections = 255 //Compulsory. The maximum number of HTTP connections.
 *     WebRoot = ARoot //Compulsory. Path in the ObjectConfigurationDatabase of the object that acts as the root for the service. This object shall inherit from HttpDataExportI.
 *     IsTextMode = 1 //Optional (default = 1). If the GET option TextMode is not set, the reply is either sent as text/html (IsTextMode = 1) or as text/json (IsTextMode = 0). With the former GetAsText is called on the web root object, while with the latter GetAsStructuredData is called instead.
 *     ChunkSize = 32 //Optional (default = 32). The maximum size of the chunks in which the reply bode is divided to perform the chunked transfer encoding mode.
 * }
 * </pre>
