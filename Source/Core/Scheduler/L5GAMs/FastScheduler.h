 * @brief The Fast scheduler.
 * @details The syntax in the configuration stream has to be:
 *
 * +Scheduler = {\n
 *    Class = FastScheduler
 *    NoWait = 0 //Wait for all the cycles to terminate before executing the executables of the next cycle. Default is 0
 *     ...\n
 *    TimingDataSource = "Name of the TimingDataSource"
 *    +ErrorMessage = { //Optional. Fired every time there is an execution error. Name is only an example.
 *        Class = Message
 *        ...
 *    }
 * }\n
 *
 * @details This scheduler executes from the beginning a number of threads and keeps them executing across the state transitions.
 * The number of spawned threads depends on the cpus defined. It is the summatory over the number of cpus of [max(Ti)] where max(Ti)
 * is the maximum number of RTTs on the cpu i over the states
 * To give an example, letÂ´s assume the following scenario:
 *   -State1
 *     -RTT1, cpu=1
 *     -RTT2, cpu=1
 *     -RTT3, cpu=2
 *   -State2
 *     -RTT1, cpu=3
 *     -RTT2, cpu=1
 *     -RTT3, cpu=2
 *     -RTT4, cpu=2
 *
 * Then the the scheduler will execute 5 threads:
 *   - T1 executing RTT1 in state1 and RTT2 in state2 (cpu 1)
 *   - T2 executing RTT2 in state1 and idle in state2 (cpu 1)
 *   - T3 executing RTT3 in state1 and RTT3 in state2 (cpu 2)
 *   - T4 idle in state1 and executing RTT4 in state2 (cpu 2)
 *   - T5 idle in state1 and executing RTT1 in state3 (cpu 3)
 *
 * The mapping between Tx and RTTy is computed in the configuration stage.
