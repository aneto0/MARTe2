 * @brief A MemoryMapBroker which stores the signals in a DataSourceI memory only after a Trigger signal being asserted.
 * @details This BrokerI implementation stores the GAM data in an internal memory buffer.
 * Every time a triggering signal is set to 1, this data is asynchronously flushed into the DataSourceI memory (retrieved with GetSignalMemoryBuffer)
 * and the Synchronise method is called on the DataSourceI. The flushing of this data is performed in the context of a different thread (SingleThreadService).
 *
 * If the number of pre-trigger buffers is greater than zero, every time a trigger is detected, the pre-trigger number of pages before that were acquired before the
 * trigger will also be flushed into the DataSourceI. If the number of post-trigger buffers is greater than zero, the post-trigger number of pages
 * after the trigger will also be flushed into the DataSourceI.
 *
 * The Triggering signal shall be the first signal of the DataSourceI (i.e. the signal with the name GetSignalName(0, name)) and shall have
 * type uint8. All the signals shall have one and only one sample. The DataSourceI shall return GetNumberOfMemoryBuffers() == 1.
 *
 * Only one GAM is allowed to interact with this MemoryMapAsyncTriggerOutputBroker (an IOGAM can be used to collate all the signals).
 * 
 * The DataSource shall call the UnlinkDataSource in the DataSourceI::Purge.
