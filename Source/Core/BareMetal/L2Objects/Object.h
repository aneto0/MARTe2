 * @brief The root object of the framework.
 *
 * @details The MARTe Object is a class which offers the following functionality:
 *  - Its life cycle is managed by a smart pointer mechanism (see Reference);
 *  - Can be automatically constructed in runtime by the class name of its derived class;
 *  - Provides a standard initialisation/construction interface;
 *  - Is introspectable and enables reflection of derived classes;
 *  - The allocation heap for the object can be selected by the end-user.

     *  at a given object this is destroyed.
     * Nevertheless, this does not prevent developers from creating internal references, so that there will
     *  be at least one reference pointing at the Object and thus it never gets destroyed.
     * An example: A is a specialised ReferenceContainer and has a member b which is also a ReferenceContainer.
     *  b contains an element C (b.Get(0)) which in turn contains a reference to A. A will then always have at least one
     *  unreachable reference pointing as b can only be destroyed (thus calling Delete(0) when A is destroyed,
     *  but A cannot be destroyed because it has a reference pointing at it. Upon calling this method, A is expected to remove all the references
     *  from b so that no implicit links exist and the global Purge (see ReferenceContainer::Purge) can remove all
     *  the references from the application.
