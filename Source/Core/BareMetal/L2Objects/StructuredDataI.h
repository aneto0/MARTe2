 * @brief Interface definition for any database that can store and retrieve AnyType values.
 * @details Classes that implement this interface are capable of storing and retrieving,
 * against any given name, data that is represented as an AnyType.
 *
 * The root node always exits and is anonymous to the users of the interface. This implies that the following
 * function calls are valid: CreateAbsolute("A.B.C")  && CreateAbsolute("D.E.F") &&
 * MoveToRoot() && MoveAbsolute("A.B.C") && MoveAbsolute("D.E.F")
 *
 * Irrespectively of the interface the implementation shall support the concepts of navigable nodes and leafs
 * and shall support the following features:
 *
 * - Nodes shall be identified by a name;
 * - Leafs shall be identified by a name;
 * - One node may contain one or more nodes;
 * - One node may contain one or more leafs;
 * - One node shall not contain any AnyType value;
 * - One leaf shall contain one, and only one, AnyType value;
 * - Leafs shall not contain nodes;
 * - A write operation shall create a new leaf;
 * - A read operation shall be performed on an existing leaf;
 * - The database shall know at any time what is the current node (i.e. the node against which the latest Move or
 * Create operation was performed).
