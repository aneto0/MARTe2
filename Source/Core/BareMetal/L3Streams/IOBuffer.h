 * @brief Class which represents a generic input output buffer intended to be
 * used by any kind of streams.
 *
 * @details This class represents a naked memory buffer with a pointer at the
 * beginning. It adds a movable pointer across the memory area and attributes
 * to get the size of the filled area and the readable area of the buffer.
 *
 * This class implements basic methods for read, write and seek operations
 * on the buffer which are virtual to avoid overloading in children.
 *
 * The most important functions are the inline PutC and GetC which are used
 * in Printf and GetToken functions and are shared by all children (besides
 * the implementation of NoMoreSpaceToWrite and NoMoreDataToRead depends on
 * the specific derived class implementation)
