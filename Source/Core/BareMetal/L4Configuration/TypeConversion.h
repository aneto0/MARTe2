 * @brief Converts between two types.
 *
 * @details The allowed basic type conversions are between the following types:\n
 *   (u)int{8,16,32,64} | float{32,64} | StreamString | char8[1:127] | char8 * (char array created on heap) | Vector<char8>;\n
 * It is possible converting vectors of these types between them if the number of elements in the two vectors is the same:\n
 *   (u)int{8,16,32,64}[] | float{32,64}[] | StreamString[] | char8[1:127][1:127] | char8 ** (memory created on heap) | Matrix<char8>;\n
 * It is possible converting matrices of these types between them if the numbers of rows and columns in the two matrices are the same:\n
 *   (u)int{8,16,32,64}[][] | float{32,64}[][] | StreamString[][] | char8[1:127][1:127][1:127] | char8 *** (memory created on heap);\n
 *
 * @details It is possible to convert one class or structure to another. The classes must be introspectable and registered into the
 * ClassRegistryDatabase. The conversion between two objects will return true if they have the same number of members and if each member
 * of the source is convertible to the respective member of the destination.
 *
 * @details It is possible to convert  a StructuredDataI (i.e a ConfigurationDatabase) to a class or structure. The destination class must be
 * introspectable and registered into the ClassRegistryDatabase. If the StructuredDataI source represents a class introspectable and registered into
 * the ClassRegistryDatabase the members will be converted respecting the order in the class declaration, otherwise the members will be
 * converted respecting the order of the elements in the StructuredDataI source.
 *
 * @details It is possible to convert  a class or structure into a StructuredDataI (i.e ConfigurationDatabase). The source class must be
 * introspectable and registered into the ClassRegistryDatabase.
 *
 * @details It is possible to convert between two StructuredDataI. See StructuredDataI::Copy().
 *
 * @param[out] destination the converted type.
 * @param[in] source the type to be converted.
 * @return true if the conversion succeeds, false otherwise.
 * Note that the conversion must be supported and successful for each dimension.
 * @pre
 *   source.GetNumberOfElements([0:2]) == destination.GetNumberOfElements([0:2]);\n
 *   In case of source or destination representing a char8 array or table, the size must be less than 127 characters for each dimension.
 * @post
 *   destination holds the converted type of source
