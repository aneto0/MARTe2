 * @brief This class is a singly linked node which is intended to be chained
 * with other nodes, creating an unbounded singly linked list.
 *
 * @details This class represents, in its broader extent, an unbounded singly
 * list ADT, i.e. a list whose nodes can only be accessed browsing from one
 * node to the next. In fact, the class itself represents an implicit single
 * node, from which the user can access the next one. So, all the operations
 * like adding, inserting, peeking, etc, are relative to this implicit node.
