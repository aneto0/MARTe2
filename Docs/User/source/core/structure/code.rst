Code organisation
=================

In order to ease the portability to other architectures and operating systems the code is organised in three tiers and seven levels.

Each tier is an independent library.  The ``BareMetal`` library is designed to be independent from the file system and from the scheduler, thus allowing to deploy the framework in very embedded systems.

Each level encapsulates a given functional concept and only depends on the functionality provided by any levels above it.

================================================================ ============

Portability
-----------

The operating system and architecture dependent code is encapsulated in the ``Architecture`` and ``Environment`` folders inside the ``L1Portability`` and  ``L6App`` folders. In the levels' root folders no operating system and architecture code shall exist.

.. image:: Structure-2.png

Based on the :doc:`Makefile </core/makefile/makefile>` ``ARCHITECTURE`` and ``ENVIRONMENT`` identifiers, the correct header files will be included during the code compilation.

.. code-block:: c++
 
   #include INCLUDE_FILE_ARCHITECTURE(ARCHITECTURE,AtomicA.h)
   #include INCLUDE_FILE_ENVIRONMENT(ENVIRONMENT,BasicFileProperties.h) 

Each new operating system or architecture will have to create a new folder with the operating system or architecture identifier and implement all the relevant files.

Namespace
---------

A single namespace, named ``MARTe``, is used for all the core library (and for the MARTe2-components).
